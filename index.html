<h2>Personal info</h2>
<p>
Here is my current <a href="Han_CV.pdf"> CV </a>.
</p>
<p>I grew up in Shanghai, China, a city near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Yangtze river</a>. My name in Chinese writing is 王含. 
</p>
<p>
I went to the <a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>University of Science and Technology of China</a> in Hefei for my undergraduate studies, where I developed an interest in physics. Then I went to New York, USA, where I earned a Ph.D. from the <a href="http://cims.nyu.edu" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://cims.nyu.edu/~obuhler/Oliver_Buhler/Welcome.html" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Oliver Bühler</a>. There, I was exposed to beauties in geophysics fluid dynamics; a fateful event was learning about the power laws in the Gage-Nastrom spectrum and its  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFMZIBBQNAY" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>(dis)connections</a> with classical two-dimentional theories， My PhD work developed some analytical methods that can help us gain dynamical insights from in-situ observational data. My journey continued at University of Toronto, where I spent 1.5 years working with Nicolas Grisouard, mainly exploring applications of deep learning to disentangling balanced and unbalances flows. Since April 2022, I started my second postdoc at University of Edinburgh, working with Jacques Vanneste and remotely with William R. Young on interactions between deep-water surface gravity waves and balanced flows.

<p>
During my spare time I like learning about nature in general. Here is my  <a href=https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&user_id=jinkou&verifiable=any> profile </a> on my favorite social network:
