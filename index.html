        <h2>Personal info</h2>
        <p>
            Here is my current <a href="Han_CV.pdf"> CV </a>.
        </p>
        <p>I grew up in Shanghai, China, a city near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze" target="_blank">Yangtze River</a>. My name in Chinese is 王含.</p>
        <p>
            I attended the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science_and_Technology_of_China" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology of China</a> in Hefei for my undergraduate studies, where I developed an interest in physics. I then moved to New York, USA, where I earned a Ph.D. from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courant_Institute_of_Mathematical_Sciences" target="_blank">Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://cims.nyu.edu/~obuhler/Oliver_Buhler/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Oliver Bühler</a>. There, I was exposed to beauties in geophysical fluid dynamics. A fateful event was learning about the power laws in the Gage-Nastrom spectrum and their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFMZIBBQNAY" target="_blank">(dis)connections</a> with classical two-dimensional theories. This developed my penchant to studying how to disentangle waves and balanced motions in the atmosphere and ocean, and over the years, I have been developing different tools for that. 
	    </p>
        <p>
			My Ph.D. work developed analytical methods to help us gain dynamical insights from in-situ observational data. Then, at University of Toronto, where I spent 1.5 years working with <a href="https://sites.physics.utoronto.ca/nicolasgrisouard" target="_blank">Nicolas Grisouard</a>, I explored deep learning algorithms to extract internal tides (an important component in oceanic waves) from two-dimensional spatial data. From April 2022 till September 2024, I did my second postdoc at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by
			<a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~vanneste/index.html#footer1-2q" target="_blank">Jacques Vanneste</a> and
			<a href="http://www-pord.ucsd.edu/wryoung/" target="_blank">Bill Young</a> to study the interactions between deep-water surface gravity waves and currents in the ocean. Currently, I'm working at University of Hamburg as a Research Assistant and Project Leader in the <a href="https://www.trr-energytransfers.de/" target="_blank">"TRR 181"</a> research center.

            You may notice that my work locations over the recent years overlap greatly with <a href="https://tolmak.khtos.com/" target="_blank"> Kostiantyn Tolmachov</a>. During my spare time, I like learning more about nature. Here is my <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&user_id=jinkou&verifiable=any" target="_blank">profile</a> on my favorite social network.
