<h2>Personal info</h2>
<p>
Here is my current <a href="Han_CV.pdf"> CV </a>.
</p>
<p>I grew up in Shanghai, China, a city near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze" target="_blank">Yangtze River</a>. My name in Chinese is 王含.</p>
<p>
I attended the <a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology of China</a> in Hefei for my undergraduate studies, where I developed an interest in physics. I then moved to New York, USA, where I earned a Ph.D. from the <a href="http://cims.nyu.edu" target="_blank">Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://cims.nyu.edu/~obuhler/Oliver_Buhler/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Oliver Bühler</a>. There, I was exposed to beauties in geophysical fluid dynamics. A fateful event was learning about the power laws in the Gage-Nastrom spectrum and their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFMZIBBQNAY" target="_blank">(dis)connections</a> with classical two-dimensional theories. My Ph.D. work developed analytical methods to help us gain dynamical insights from in-situ observational data. My journey continued at the University of Toronto, where I spent 1.5 years working with Nicolas Grisouard, mainly exploring applications of deep learning algorithms to help disentangle balanced and unbalanced flows. In April 2022, I began my second postdoc at the University of Edinburgh, working with Jacques Vanneste and (remotely) with William R. Young on the interactions between deep-water surface gravity waves and balanced flows.
</p>
<p>
During my spare time, I like learning about nature. Here is my <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&user_id=jinkou&verifiable=any" target="_blank">profile</a> on my favorite social network.
